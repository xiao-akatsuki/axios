## Code of Conduct

## Using GitHub Issues
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. 

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small sample project that reproduces the problem.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
Please report security vulnerabilities using GitHub issues.

## Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the Contributor License Agreement. Signing the contributor’s agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do. Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests.

## Code Conventions and Housekeeping
- None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help. They can also be added after the original pull request but before a merge.

- Make sure all new .java files have a Javadoc class comment with at least an @author tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is for.

- Add yourself as an @author to the .java files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).

- Add some Javadocs.

- A few unit tests would help a lot as well — someone has to do it.

- If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current main branch (or other target branch in the project).

- When writing a commit message please follow these conventions.
